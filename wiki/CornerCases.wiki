= Introduction =

The A-Bus must be robust, rock solid, regardless of the fooling by the end-user program.

Better anticipate any weird corner cases and test them than endure them while fixing a troublesome application.

= Corner Cases =

These are corner cases that have to be appropriately handled by A-Bus, and _tested_.
Of course, automated testing is a must.

Any failure case must not let the system non working, i.e. later valid rpc must still run ok (when applicable).

 * RPC to a non existent service name
 * RPC to a non existent service, that used to exist
 * RPC to an existent service not responding
 * RPC to a service, client not listening the response
 * RPC to a service having its input message queue full
 * RPC to a service, client having its response message queue full
 * RPC to a service for non existent method/property
 * malformed json-rpc command/response
  * zero-length message
  * arbitrary-length binary message
  * subtly broken json message (e.g. missing brace, ..)
 * RPC command/response bigger than max bearer message size
 * huge number of items in json message
 * huge level of nesting in json message
