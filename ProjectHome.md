A-Bus is a lightweight message bus system, a simple way for embedded applications to talk to one another, merely in professional world, but not restricted to. The message bus is built on top of a one-to-one message passing JSON-RPC framework. There's no daemon involved in the message bus.

Got trapped in the past with a clumsy inter process communication bus? No sane alternative to propose as a replacement for a stinky legacy middle-ware? It's now time to stop the hurting and get your chance to escape the wheel of reincarnation.

The A-Bus project is in design stage, please read the Wiki documents for that matter and join the [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/abus-discuss).
